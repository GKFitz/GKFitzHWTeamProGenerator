Gillian's Team Profile Generator

## Description
This application generates a team profile page for a development team using the inquirer package. It will first ask the user to generate a manager profile, which will ask for a name, an employee id, an email address, which has a clickable link that redirects to the default mail program, and an office number. Once that is done the manager can add as many engineers and intern profiles to the team page. The engineer and the intern profile will include the same things as the manager profile, accept for the office number. For the engineer, the profile will include a github name that when clicked will redirected to the github account it is associated with, and the intern profiles would include the school the intern is associated with.
